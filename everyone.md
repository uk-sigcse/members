# Members of UK SIGCSE
This is an editable _Who's Who_ listing of:

* Individual members of [uki-sigcse.acm.org](https://uki-sigcse.acm.org/)  
* People in the UK and Ireland involved Computing Education Research and Computer Science Education

Ordered alphabetically by SURNAME, this UK & Ireland version is similar to Amy Ko's global list of people at the bottom of the page at [faculty.washington.edu/ajko/cer](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/cer). 

Some of these people lead research group pages which are also listed at [uki-sigcse.acm.org/research-groups](https://uki-sigcse.acm.org/research-groups/).
